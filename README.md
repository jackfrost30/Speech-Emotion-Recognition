# Speech Emotion Recognition


Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a groundbreaking application aimed at identifying and categorizing emotions conveyed through speech into various output classes such as anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, and neutrality.

Speech, being the most natural form of human expression, serves as a pivotal medium for communication in computer applications, enhancing user interaction and experience.

Our project focuses on developing a user-friendly UI interface equipped with options to record, pause, and stop speech inputs. Users can listen to recorded audio, save files locally, and utilize them as needed.

For this endeavor, we utilize the Ryerson Audio Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS), containing 7356 files contributed by 24 professional actors. These files encompass a diverse range of emotional expressions in a neutral North American accent.

Let's embark on this journey of exploring and harnessing the power of speech emotion recognition together!
